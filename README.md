# 💻👩‍💻 My Portfolio 📱✨

Welcome! This is my portfolio: a dynamic, API-driven web application built with **Svelte**, designed to showcase my projects, skills, and experience as a developer.

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike static portfolios, this version retrieves project data from a live API, enabling easy content management and scalability, just as in real-world production environments.

## 📸 Live Demo
